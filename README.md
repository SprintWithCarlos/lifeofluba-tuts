## Following Life of Luba dev's tutorials

I decided to follow Luba Yudasina's recommendations in her video titled "How to learn to code" to evaluate this process is for starters.

So if you are starting your learning journey, first of all: congratulatins! You are brave and if you keep practicing you will reach your goals.

Please use a 5X factor for all the times I spend completing the tutorials, I do this for a life and have taken beginner courses several times, so for me is easier and I can go much faster.
