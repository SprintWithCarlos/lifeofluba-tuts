## Following Life of Luba dev's tutorials

I decided to follow Luba Yudasina's recommendations in her video titled "How to learn to code" to evaluate this process is for starters.

So if you are starting your learning journey, first of all: congratulatins! You are brave and if you keep practicing you will reach your goals.

Please use a 5X factor for all the times I spend completing the tutorials, I do this for a life and have taken beginner courses several times, so for me is easier and I can go much faster.

## Hope you like it!

I put every step in a separated branch so you can have a picture of the repository at each stage

## Step one: Make a website

Codecademy chose an online text editor as their medium to teach. It has pros and cons:
| Pros | Cons |
| --- | --- |
| Student save time since there is no configuration of local enviroments and simply focus on learning | Real world coding is very different to this online editor, it's a _quid pro quo_ for quicker learning |
| | It has no autocompletion, no autoformatter. It makes you loose time. The exercise ask you to type instead of coding (really good advice) but it doesn't prevent you for doing so |

Not enforcing autoformatting is losing one key opportunity to visually demonstrate a key concept in programming such as inheritance. Indentation helps to visualize parent-children relationships.

Regarding ID's uniqueness, you can read this [article](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/127178/two-html-elements-with-same-id-attribute-how-bad-is-it-really) where the idea is very well explained.
I completed the course at 20:00, I had to avoid some distractions that prevented me to finish quicker.
